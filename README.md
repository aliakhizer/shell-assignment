# Shell Assignment 

Welcome to my Shell Assignment Practice repository! In this repository, I have completed a single task to enhance my shell scripting skills.

## Task: Download & Save Images

I created 2 scripts, script 1 allows users to pass url of an image and it downloads the image from url and saves it in folder. You can also pass arguments for different functionalities shown below.



./file1.sh [ -p PATH | -t ] [ -o FILENAME ] [ -r RESOLUTION ]

        -p to save image on specific path.
        -t to save image in /tmp.
        -o to save image with specific name.
        -r to set custom resoltion for image.


Script2 copies to home directory and adds a cron job to download a new image after a specific interval.
